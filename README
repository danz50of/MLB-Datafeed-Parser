MLB provides an official stat feed, in XML format, located at http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/. This is the exact same data used in MLB's own applications, such as the GameDay Flash app and the MLB At Bat application for iPhone/iPad/etc. Thus, the format will probably change slowly if at all, and they should continue to provide it so those apps can use it.

The license says you can use the data for non-commercial, non-bulk purposes. Bear that in mind.

Use downloader.rb to download the boxscore files in a range of dates. You have to edit the file to specify the range. Right now, it only supports the datafeed for Minnesota Twins games.

When that's done, run parser.rb to parse those XML datafiles and generate a CSV file of each Twins player's performance; that performance is measured as the 10-day moving average of their wOBA, which is calculated from the basic boxscore data.

I then upload the CSV to Google Docs to generate a line chart, but you can do whatever you want with it.
