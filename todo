What do we want the baseball parser to do?

Download all games for a certain team...
- on a given date
- before a given date
- after a given date
- within a given date range (inclusive)

Be able to determine the last date that was downloaded

Keep parsing totally separate from downloading

- Parse all boxscores at once
- Parse boxscore for a single day
- Parse boxscores in a date range
- Parse all the boxscores for a given year

Record player name, wOBA, date... graph them as lines with wOBA on the Y axis and date on the X axis

Export a CSV file for Google Spreadsheet
