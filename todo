What do we want the baseball parser to do?

Download all games for a certain team...
- on a given date
- before a given date
- after a given date
- within a given date range (inclusive)

Be able to determine the last date that was downloaded

Keep parsing totally separate from downloading

- Parse all boxscores at once
- Parse boxscore for a single day
- Parse boxscores in a date range
- Parse all the boxscores for a given year

Record player name, wOBA, date... graph them as lines with wOBA on the Y axis and date on the X axis

Export a CSV file for Google Spreadsheet
Column A: Names
Row 1: Dates

"","2010-05-23","2010-05-24"
"Joe Mauer","0.3","0.8"
"Justin Morneau","0.8","0.9"
"Delmon Young","0.3",""

Build a Matrix class that can export a CSV file
matrix.set(row_key, col_key, value)
matrix.set("Joe Mauer", "2010-05-23", "0.3")
matrix.write_csv(filename)

The generated graph is really jumbled... makes it look like it's basically all random. Try calculating 10-day moving averages and graphing that instead.
